## Comparative Study of Clustering Algorithms for Covid-19 Detection

Covid 19 is a dangerous virus which has taken the lives of many innocent
people all over the world. Most of the deaths are caused because of the
patient unable to identify the presence of virus in their body due to which it
becomes too late to react and get treatment as soon as possible, which
ultimately resulted as casualties. This project will help to detect and identify
whether the virus is present in the human body with the help of symptoms
in the early stage and they can recover from it.

## Project ðŸ˜Ž

We have applied two types of clustering algorithms, K-means and
BIRCH to our Covid-19 dataset.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION (*^_^*) - Kaggle
Our dataset contained 27 columns and 3,16,800 rows. The columns
contained binary values representing the presence of various symptoms
such as dry cough, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, nasal
congestion, tiredness as well as other characteristics of the patient such as
their gender, whether they were in contact with other Covid-19 positive
individuals as well as their country of residence.

The following are the seven primary variables that will influence whether or
not someone has coronavirus disease, with descriptions of each variable:
Country: List of countries visited by the individual.
Age: According to WHO Age Group Standard, each person's age group is
classified.
Symptoms: Fever, tiredness, breathing difficulty, dry cough, and sore
throat are the five prominent symptoms of COVID-19, according to the
WHO.
Any additional symptoms such as Diarrhea, Pains, Nasal Congestion,
Runny Nose, and Other
Severity: The severity degree, Moderate, Mild Severe
Has the person made touch with any other COVID-19 patients?
